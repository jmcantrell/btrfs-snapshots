# Show that `is_same_event` can recognize timestamps occurring within the same event.
#
# For the purposes of this project, the term "event" is defined as the set of
# all timestamps that share the same timestamp parts.
#
# In other words, an hourly event is the set of all timestamps that share the
# same year, month, day, and hour.
#
# For example, the following timestamps are part of the same hourly event
# because they happen during the same hour:
#
#   2001-01-02T12:00:00Z
#   2001-01-02T12:34:56Z
#   2001-01-02T12:59:59Z
#
# However, the same event would not contain the following timestamps:
#
#   2001-01-02T11:59:59Z
#   2001-01-02T13:00:00Z
